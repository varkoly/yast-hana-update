<h3>Cluster Configuration</h3>
<p>
    This step shows the generated update plan for the clustered SAP HANA system.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the Wizard handles only the cluster itself, and all SAP HANA-related steps are marked as <b>[Manual
    step]</b> in the plan.
</p>
<p>
    Please also note, that in order to disable System Replication, the secondary SAP HANA instance has to be stopped first, and then started again.
</p>
<p>
    Once you click <b>Next</b>, the Wizard will apply proposed changes to the cluster.
</p>
<p>
    Click <b>Skip</b> to skip current step. <i>Note:</i> use this function with caution! Misusing this function can lead
    to an inconsistent cluster configuration.
