<h3 style="color: #00843E">Welcome to the SUSE SAP HANA Cluster Update</h3>
<p>This wizard allows for upgrading SAP &reg; HANA &reg; System Replication (Scale-Up) instances in a SUSE cluster setup by performing a so-called <i>Near Zero Downtime Upgrade</i>.</p>

<p>The wizard handles the part of the procedure related to the SUSE cluster, while some of the steps have to be performed manually by the SAP HANA admin.</p>

<p><i>Before you begin:</i></p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure that you have created a full backup of all HANA instances and that all cluster nodes
    have password-less SSH access to one another.</li>
    <li>Make sure that you have created the user in the local HANA userstore under the key <code>SRTAKEOVER</code> and granted the required priviliges.
        Please refer to the section <i>Use SAP HANA System Replication for 
        Near Zero Downtime Upgrades</i> of the <i>SAP HANA Administration Guide</i> for more information.
    </li>
</ul>
